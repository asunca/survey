# Data Flow Architecture - Critical Decisions for AI Survey Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the critical architectural decisions needed for the AI-powered survey platform's data flow and module integration. These decisions will impact development complexity, scalability, performance, and operational costs.

## Current System Overview

**Four-Module Architecture:**
- **Organization Module:** Employee data and organizational schemas
- **Library Module:** Questions, surveys, and AI generation
- **Delivery Module:** Survey distribution and response collection  
- **Reporting Module:** AI-powered analytics and insights

**Data Flow Pattern:**
```
Organization Module → Delivery Module → Reporting Module
     ↑                      ↓
Library Module ←────────────┘
```

## Critical Decision Points

### 1. Inter-Module Communication Architecture

**Decision Required:** How should the four modules communicate with each other?

#### Option A: Shared Database
**Architecture:** All modules access a single PostgreSQL instance with different schemas

**Pros:**
- Immediate data consistency across modules
- Simple ACID transactions
- Easy to implement joins across module data
- Lower infrastructure complexity
- Faster initial development

**Cons:**
- Tight coupling between modules
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to scale modules independently
- Schema evolution conflicts
- Database becomes bottleneck at scale

**Best For:** MVP and early development phases

#### Option B: API-Based Microservices
**Architecture:** Each module exposes REST APIs, communicates via HTTP

**Pros:**
- Loose coupling between services
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Clear service boundaries
- Technology stack flexibility per module
- Team autonomy in development

**Cons:**
- Network latency overhead
- Complex error handling across services
- Eventual consistency challenges
- API versioning complexity
- Higher operational overhead

**Best For:** Production systems requiring independent scaling

#### Option C: Event-Driven Architecture
**Architecture:** Modules communicate via message queues (RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka)

**Pros:**
- Highly decoupled and resilient
- Excellent scalability
- Natural async processing
- Easy to add new modules
- Built-in retry and failure handling

**Cons:**
- Complex debugging and monitoring
- Eventual consistency model
- Message ordering challenges
- Higher learning curve
- More infrastructure components

**Best For:** High-scale, enterprise-grade systems

### 2. AI Processing Strategy

**Decision Required:** When and where should AI analysis occur?

#### Processing Timing Options

**Real-Time Processing:**
- **Survey Generation:** User waits 5-10 seconds for LLM to create survey
- **Org Schema Analysis:** User waits 30-60 seconds for hierarchy extraction
- **Report Insights:** Generated immediately when survey completes

**Batch Processing:**
- **Survey Generation:** Background job with status updates
- **Org Schema Analysis:** Async processing with email notification
- **Report Insights:** Scheduled analysis (hourly/daily)

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **Survey Generation:** Real-time (user experience priority)
- **Org Schema Analysis:** Real-time for small orgs, batch for large
- **Report Insights:** Batch processing (cost optimization)

#### Resource Management Strategies

**Dedicated AI Infrastructure:**
```
Separate AI processing servers
- Dedicated GPU instances for LLM inference
- Vector database for semantic search
- Queue management for job processing
```

**Serverless AI Processing:**
```
Cloud Functions/Lambda for AI tasks
- Pay-per-use model
- Automatic scaling
- No infrastructure management
```

**Hybrid Cloud AI:**
```
Mix of managed services and custom infrastructure
- OpenAI API for complex analysis
- Local models for simple tasks
- Caching layer for repeated queries
```

### 3. Workflow Orchestration

**Decision Required:** How to manage complex multi-step processes?

#### Option 1: Simple Background Jobs (Redis Queue)
**Implementation:** Basic job queue with workers

**Use Cases:**
- Single-step background tasks
- Simple retry logic
- Low complexity workflows

**Example:**
```javascript
await queue.add('generate-report', { surveyId });
await queue.add('send-notification', { userId, message });
```

#### Option 2: Workflow Engine (Temporal.io/Apache Airflow)
**Implementation:** Dedicated workflow orchestration platform

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-step processes with dependencies
- Complex error handling and rollback
- Long-running workflows
- State management across steps

**Example:**
```javascript
const reportWorkflow = {
  steps: [
    'validate-survey-completion',
    'extract-response-data',
    'run-ai-analysis',
    'generate-insights',
    'create-visualizations',
    'send-completion-notification'
  ],
  retryPolicy: { maxAttempts: 3 },
  timeout: '30 minutes'
};
```

#### Option 3: Serverless Workflows (Google Cloud Workflows)
**Implementation:** Cloud-native workflow orchestration

**Use Cases:**
- Event-driven processing
- Integration with cloud services
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-execution model

### 4. Data Consistency Strategy

**Decision Required:** How to handle data consistency across modules?

#### Strong Consistency
- All modules see the same data immediately
- Database transactions ensure ACID properties
- Higher complexity but guaranteed correctness

#### Eventual Consistency
- Modules may see different data temporarily
- Eventually all modules converge to same state
- Better scalability but requires careful design

#### Bounded Consistency
- Critical data (user permissions) is strongly consistent
- Analytics data (reports) can be eventually consistent
- Hybrid approach balancing performance and correctness

## Performance vs Cost Trade-offs

### Key Questions for Decision Making

1. **User Experience Requirements:**
   - Can users wait 30 seconds for survey generation?
   - Is real-time org schema analysis mandatory?
   - How quickly must reports be available?

2. **Scale Expectations:**
   - Expected concurrent users: 10, 100, 1000?
   - Survey volume: 100, 1000, 10000 per month?
   - Organization size: 50, 500, 5000 employees?

3. **Budget Constraints:**
   - LLM API costs vs infrastructure costs
   - Development time vs operational complexity
   - Cloud services vs self-managed infrastructure

4. **Technical Expertise:**
   - Team experience with microservices
   - DevOps and monitoring capabilities
   - Preference for managed vs custom solutions
