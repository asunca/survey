## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Data Storage for 5-Year Retention
**Recommended Approach:**
- **Hot Data** (last 6 months): PostgreSQL for fast access
- **Warm Data** (6 months - 2 years): Compressed PostgreSQL partitions
- **Cold Data** (2+ years): Archive to cloud storage (S3/GCS) with metadata in main DB

**Report Storage Strategy:**
- Don't store static HTML reports
- Store report configurations and regenerate on demand
- Cache frequently accessed report data for performance
- Use versioning for report templates

### Progressive Feature Rollout
**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. **Months 1-2:** Phase 1 (Basic stats) + real-time response counts
2. **Months 3-4:** Phase 2 (Basic NLP) + improved visualizations
3. **Months 5-7:** Phase 3 (Pattern recognition) + anomaly detection
4. **Months 8-12:** Phase 4 (Predictive analytics) + advanced insights
5. **Year 2+:** Phase 5 (Advanced AI) + specialized features
